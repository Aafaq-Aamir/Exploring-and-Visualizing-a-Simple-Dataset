Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization
📌 Task Objective

The goal of this task was to explore the Iris dataset by loading, inspecting, and visualizing the data to understand its structure, trends, and patterns. The process focused on basic data exploration, statistical summaries, and visual insights.

📂 Dataset Used

Iris Dataset – A commonly used dataset containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

⚙ Models/Methods Applied

Although no machine learning models were applied in this task, several exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were used, including:

Data inspection using shape, head(), info(), and describe()

Visualizations using:

Scatter plot for feature relationships

Histograms to show distribution patterns

Box plots to detect outliers and compare spread

Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

📊 Key Results and Findings

The dataset is clean, well-structured, and has no missing values.

Clear separation was observed between species based on petal length and petal width.

Feature distributions showed that Setosa species is distinct with smaller petal measurements.

Few mild outliers were detected in features like sepal width but overall variability stayed within a normal range.

Visualizations helped in understanding how different features contribute to species differentiation
